# Estimation-ReinforcementLearning
An environment for training reinforcement learning algorithms on Estimation card game.

## Estimation Rules
Estimation is a game for 4 players in which the standard international 52-card pack is used. The game is normally played counter-clockwise. The objective of the game is for players to try to estimate the number of tricks they can get in each round.

### Cards and Dealing
13 cards are dealt to each player, the cards in each suit ranking from low to high: 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - J - Q - K - A.

### Bidding
The bidding is split into two phases. In the first phase, players bid in turn according to the estimated number of tricks they think they can get, or declare a "Dash Call", which means that the estimated number of tricks is zero. Players have to declare their trump suit along with their bid. The winner of the bidding round is the player who estimates the highest number of tricks. In case of a tie, the trump suit is used to determine the winner. The suits are ranked from high to low: No Trump (NT), Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs.

After the winner is determined, players are given a chance to estimate the number of tricks they will get based on the trump suit that was selected. The maximum number of tricks a player can estimate is the number estimated by the winner of the bidding round.

### Play
The winner of the bidding round leads the first trick and players must follow suit. Each trick is won by the highest card and the winner of each trick leads the next.
Players unable to follow it have the option to use "trump" cards, which are considered the highest among other cards. The winner of the trick is the player who uses a trump, unless a higher trump is used.
The round ends when players are out of cards.

## How to use
The environment was designed to be as close to OpenAI gym as possible. Each simulation will be just one round of a full game, ending with a calculation of scores.
```
import env
env = env.Estimation()
obs, done, info = env.reset()
while True:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, done, info = env.step(action)
    
    if done:
        print(env.scores)
        break
```

To know what's happening in the game, the info dict is provided. It contains information about:

    1. The current player (current_player)
    
    2. The current player cards (current_player_cards)
    
    3. The order of the players (player_order)
    
    4. The cards of all player (players_cards, this will be dictionary)
    
    5. The players' bids (players_bids)
    
    6. The cards on the table (table)
    
    7. The suit of the table (table_suit)
    
    8. The trump suit (trump_suit)
    
    9. The played cards (played_cards)
    
    10. The scores (scores, which are only updates at the end)
    
Through this info dict, you are able to handcraft the observation the way you want and not stick to the observation supplied by the environment. 

Alternatively, you can pass the class an argument with a function that return the obervation based on the attributes of the environment. For example, this is the class used by default.
```
def change_state(env):
    """
    A function which return the observation state of the current player
    The first 52 elements [0:52] are label encodings of the cards:
        a) 0 - the card isn't played yet and isn't in hand
        b) 1 - the card is in hand
        c) 2 - the card is on the table
        d) 3 - the card has been played before

    The next 8 elements [52:60] contain information about the bids and tricks
        a) [52:54] - contains info about current player bids and tricks
        b) [54:60] - contains info about other 3 players

    The elements in [60:62] contain the table and trump suits label encodings
        a) 0 encodes clubs
        b) 1 encodes diamonds
        c) 2 encodes hearts
        d) 3 encodes spades
        e) 4 encodes no suit

    The last three elements [62:64] encode the total asked tricks, round no. and current player order

```

This function is elementary, and other functions can be used to make more meaningful represenations of the current state of the environment using other techniques.

The main attributes that you'd want to be using in making a state representation are:

    1. The current player's cards  (self.players_cards[self.current_player()])
    
    2. Cards on the table if any  (self.table)
    
    3. Previously played cards if any  (self.played_cards)
    
    4. The current player's bids and collected tricks  (self.bids[self.current_player()], self.tricks[self.current_player()])
    
    5. Other players' bids and collected tricks  (self.bids, self.tricks)
    
    6. Table and trump suits  (self.table_suit, self.trump_suit)
    
    7. The total asked tricks from all players  (self.tricks)
    
    8. The round no.  (self.round)
    
    9. The current player order on the table  (self.order)
